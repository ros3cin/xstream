For Java 7 or higher build with Maven 3

Before building:

To build:

mvn clean install

Before deploying:

copy settings-template.xml to ~/.m2/settings.xml adding your Sonatype OSSRH
username and passwords.

To deploy (optionally adding sources and javadoc jars):
mvn deploy

Easy build:
mvn package -DskipTests
NOTE: For a java 7 build, set your java home to jdk7. I was not able to enforce java 7 when using java 8
